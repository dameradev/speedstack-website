As a dev, especially if youâ€™re just starting out, you want to avoid monthly costs wherever possible. Well, I am not just starting out, but since my website is still not making me any money (at least not directly), I try to keep the cost at 0.

Nowadays there seems to be an endless amount of ways to develop/host a website, countless CMSs, and countless hosting providers, I am guilty of changing the CMS of my website 4 times already, and the main reason was money.

## Frontend site host - Vercel

I am a React dev, I use NextJs for my day job. For my blogfolio I wanted to learn something different and played around with SvelteJs, but it was lacking the community I needed, so I dumped that project after a few weeks of trial and error.

Since the current site is NextJs, Vercel was the clear winner, and if youâ€™re just an individual trying to host a site (not necessarily a Next site), I would strongly recommend going with Vercel, they have a generous free tier (basically free forever), my site is up 99.99% of the time, and setup with their UI is extremely easy.

## Hosting content on Notion

This is the thing I switched around most. I started developing my site, as a side project 7-8 months ago, and in that time I switched 4 different CMSs.

The first one I tried was Graphcms (now known as Hygraph) they did have a free tier, but I quickly realized that I would need features in their pro plan very soon, which was $300 per month, no thank you.

The next one I decided to do was Prismic, which was pretty cheap, around $10 per month I think, I used it for 2 months, and at this time a friend recommended I should try to use headless WordPress.

He sold me on the whole WP is the original blogging platform, it has been here for decades. I have never been a fan of WP I started to learn how to code after all the hype around it settled down, but decided to give it a go.

I found a hosting provider, it was around $60 per year with the first one being 50% off, so I migrated all the content to WP, at the time it was just 8 blog posts, I loved all the features it provided, the comment system, the plugins everything, one thing it was lacking was customization, and I also wasnâ€™t ready to pay yet.

So then I decided to give Notion a go. Iâ€™ve been using Notion for more than a year now, and I store everything I need here, so I thought since my whole life is in Notion, why not my blog content as well? I got the idea from [Brandon Coyer](https://braydoncoyer.dev/), he has an amazing open-source website, and he was doing the same thing.

The thing I love about Notion is the customization, you basically create everything from scratch, you add your own properties, and your own view of the posts, itâ€™s a tool that allows you to develop your system using no-code techniques, and if youâ€™re a developer you will find it easy to use. I am not an affiliate BTW.

Using Notion drops the price of running the site back to 0.

## The third technology thatâ€™s usually paid is the Database

One would argue, why would you need a database if youâ€™re using notion to store data you display, and while you can definitely use Notion to read and write data, thatâ€™s not the intended purpose of it, and it becomes very slow.

Think of it this way, whenever you have some part of your site that doesnâ€™t change much, itâ€™s a green light for notion, but when you need some more dynamic data, you need to reach for something else.

Initially, I looked into firebase as I have experience with it, but I decided against it and chose Supabase.

Itâ€™s a firebase clone and it offers a very generous free tier, which I donâ€™t expect to hit until I get 10k+ monthly visitors, hopefully, that will be soon ðŸ¤ž.

Currently, the only place I use Supabase is on the post view count, I plan to implement more features with it, and will update this post as soon as I do so.

## Conclusion

With these 3 technologies, almost any site can be built and hosted, well that is until the site gets a more significant amount of traffic, it took me a lot of experimentation to get it where it is today, and the site will likely change more in the future, I embrace that, with every new feature I learn something new. I encourage you to start building your site as soon as possible, itâ€™s a playground to train on, and itâ€™s how you show the world youâ€™re a dev.

PS: Itâ€™s not completely free, I pay around $15 per year for the domain.
