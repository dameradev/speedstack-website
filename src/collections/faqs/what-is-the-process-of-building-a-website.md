After the initial contact and upon successful agreement, we gather more information from you, by sending you a questionnaire.

We create an evaluation, and determine the tasks that need to be done in order to successfully finish the project.

After the timeline is created.

**For fixed projects**:

We determine a budget, create the project scope and wait for your confirmation

&nbsp;

**For subscription:**

Based on the selected tier

You will either be priced at the tier’s monthly price with no upfront cost, or if you decide you need extras these will be charged before the start of the project, after that the monthly subscription will kick in.

See here the [benefits of subscription,](/subscriptions) and weather that’s the right fit for you.
