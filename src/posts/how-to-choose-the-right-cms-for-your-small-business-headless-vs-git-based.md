### Git-Based CMS

### Conclusion

These were the facts, our recommendation for most websites, is using git based CMS, especially when you’re paying someone to set it up for you, as the biggest obstacle to overcome is the setup. Once this step is complete, as a user of the CMS will barely notice the difference.

The reason we recommend going the git based route, is the price point. And the fact that you’re not vendor locked in, as these solutions use your codebase to store the data, so if you ever decide that a CMS no longer fits your needs, it’s much easier to make the switch.

While most services would do the job well, we recommend CloudCannon, as they are our official partner.
